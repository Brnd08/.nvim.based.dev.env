# What's this?
This is a repository tracking configuration files for different tools that on the hole makes a nvim-based configuration.
The repository root is at ~ directory and only required files will be included via .gitignore 

# What is it tracking?
This repository *will be modified* along the way in my journey to setting a comple nvim environment (currently for macOS), this includes configuration files for:
- Shells
- Terminal applications
- vim
- nvim
- other tools & plugins (things like LSP support, utility files, etc)

This might also keep track of documentation pages and turorials that I find useful
